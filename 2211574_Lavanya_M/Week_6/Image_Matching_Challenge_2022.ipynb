    "##### Register two images from different viewpoints\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "The [Image Matching Challenge 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022/overview) Register two images from different viewpoints Kaggle competition is focused on developing computer vision models that can match pairs of images that show the same scene or object from different viewpoints. Specifically, the competition requires participants to develop algorithms that can register two images by estimating the 3D transformation that aligns them. The competition provides a dataset of image pairs along with ground-truth correspondences between the images, and participants are evaluated based on the accuracy of their registration algorithm. The goal of the competition is to promote research and development in the area of image registration, which has important applications in fields such as robotics, augmented reality, and remote sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I provide an overview of the competition and comprehensive solution to the Image Matching Challenge 2022 Kaggle competition, providing an end-to-end implementation for the problem statement, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2022/data) for the Image Matching Challenge 2022 consists of two parts: the training dataset and the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training dataset contains 5,000 pairs of images, where each pair of images shows the same object from two different viewpoints. The images are stored as grayscale images in JPEG format and have a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. Each pair of images is stored in a separate directory, with the two images named as \"left.jpg\" and \"right.jpg\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- The test dataset contains 10,000 pairs of images, with the same format as the training dataset. However, the test dataset does not have corresponding ground truth labels, which makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of different image matching algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the training and test datasets are provided as compressed ZIP files that can be downloaded from the competition page on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook has more than 25mb, So I can only upload code.\n",

    "For most of us, our best camera is part of the phone in our pocket. We may take a snap of a landmark, like the Trevi Fountain in Rome, and share it with friends. By itself, that photo is two-dimensional and only includes the perspective of our shooting location. Of course, a lot of people have taken photos of that fountain. Together, we may be able to create a more complete, three-dimensional view. What if machine learning could help better capture the richness of the world using the vast amounts of unstructured image collections freely available on the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "The process to reconstruct 3D objects and buildings from images is called Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Typically, these images are captured by skilled operators under controlled conditions, ensuring homogeneous, high-quality data. It is much more difficult to build 3D models from assorted images, given a wide variety of viewpoints, lighting and weather conditions, occlusions from people and vehicles, and even user-applied filters.\n",

    "**The first part of the problem is to identify which parts of two images capture the same physical points of a scene, such as the corners of a window. This is typically achieved with local features (key locations in an image that can be reliably identified across different views). Local features contain short description vectors that capture the appearance around the point of interest. By comparing these descriptors, likely correspondences can be established between the pixel coordinates of image locations across two or more images. This “image registration” makes it possible to recover the 3D location of the point by triangulation.**\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Google employs Structure-from-Motion techniques across many Google Maps services, such as the 3D models created from StreetView and aerial imagery. In order to accelerate research into this topic, and better leverage the volume of data already publicly available, Google presents this competition in collaboration with the University of British Columbia and Czech Technical University.\n",
